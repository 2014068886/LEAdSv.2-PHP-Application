    	<h4> What is Landslide? </h4> 
    	<p> A landslide is the movement of rock, earth, or debris down a sloped section of land. Landslides are caused by rain, earthquakes, volcanoes, or other factors that make the slope unstable. </p> <br>
    
    	<h4> What to do before a landslide? </h4>
    	<ul> 
    		<li> Get a ground assessment of your property. </li>
    		<li> Learn about the emergency-response and evacuation plans for your area. Develop your own emergency plan for your family or business. </li>
    		<li> Watch the patterns of storm-water drainage near your home, and note the places where runoff water converges, increasing flow in channels. These are areas to avoid during a storm. </li>
    		<li> Contact local officials, state geological surveys or departments of natural resources, and university departments of geology. Landslides occur where they have before, and in identifiable hazard locations </li>
    		<li> Do not build near steep slopes, close to mountain edges, near drainage ways, or natural erosion valleys. </li>
    	</ul> <br>
    
    
    	<h4> What to do during a landslide? </h4>
    	<ul> 
    		<li> Listen to local news stations on a battery-powered radio for warnings of heavy rainfall. </li>
    		<li> Listen for unusual sounds that might indicate moving debris, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together. </li>
    		<li> If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and for a change from clear to muddy water. Such changes may indicate landslide activity upstream, so be prepared to move quickly. Don't delay! Save yourself, not your belongings. </li>
    		
    	</ul> <br>
    
    	<h4> What happens when you hear the alarm? </h4> 
    	<p> Don't panic. Immediately inform the person in charge in your community or the disaster response team for immediate evacuation </p> <br>
    	
    	<h4> What does Level 1, 2, 3 means? </h4> 
    	<ul>
    		<li> Level 1 - Wait for any further announcements! </li>
    		<li> Level 2 - Get ready for an evacuation and wait for further announcements! </li>
    		<li> Level 3 - Immediate evacuation is required! </li>
    	</ul> <br>
    	
  		<h4> Do i need to have an internet connection when accessing the app? </h4>
  		<p> No, but you need to have an internet to view the IP camera </p> <br>
  		
  		<h4> Is the mobile application available only to Android? </h4>
  		<p> Yes, be ready for updates soon! </p> <br>
